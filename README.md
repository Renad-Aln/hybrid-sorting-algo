# hybrid-sorting-algo
This code describes the implementation of a hybrid algorithm that is comprised of two sorting algorithms, Insertion-Sort as an iterative approach and Quick-Sort as a recursive approach. we found that when the input size is less than 40 the insertion algorithm is faster than the quicksort algorithm, on the other hand, if the input size is 40 and larger the quicksort becomes more efficient. As a result of our experiment, we have determined that the threshold value is 40 in our hybrid algorithm.

The hybrid code was written by me (Renad Alnuaim) and (Noor Aljishi).
